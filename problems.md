1 - I'll try to import the font-family with @fontface in the woff2 format
But the problem is that i don't know how to do it, i'll try to learn it
I think i did it

2 - Another problem that i just encountered was, how can i describe the alt of the person's icon, i'll leave it empty, i don't see a decent idea

3 - I'm not sure i selected the elements in an organized way, after i finish my solution i'll see other people's solution to see what i could have done different

4 - I think that the font-size they tell us to use is way too small 13px
